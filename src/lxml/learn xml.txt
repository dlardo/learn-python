#Elements
An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's end tag.
An element can contain: other elements, text, attributes, or a mix of everything.

<root>                                          #All elements can have sub elements (child elements):
  <child>                                       #The elements in an XML document form a document tree.
    <subchild>.....</subchild>                  #
  </child>                                      #The tree starts at the root and branches to the
</root>                                         #lowest level of the tree.

#Tags
A tag is the name inside of the <>'s.  In "<to>Tove</to>", the tag is "to".

#Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element that is not a part of the data.
Attributes are probably only important to the software that wants to manipulate the data.

Ex: <file type="gif">computer.gif</file>
<file></file> is the element, and type="gif" is the attribute.

Attributes must always be quoted (single or double quotes, typically double.)

There are no rules about when to use attributes or when to use elements.
Attributes are handy in HTML. In XML my advice is to avoid them. Use elements instead.
Attributes are difficult to read and maintain. Use elements for data. Use attributes for information that is not relevant to the data.
